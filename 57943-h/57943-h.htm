<p class="pdropcap">HE
scholarly angler is here pre­sent­ed with an
exact <i>fac­sim­i­le</i> of the first En­glish trea­tise on
fish­ing. The book is of extreme interest for
several reasons, not the least curious being
that it has served as a literary quarry to so
many suc­ceed­ing writers on fishing, who have not dis­dained
to adapt the authoress’s sent­i­ments to their own use, and
even to borrow them word for word without ac­knowl­edg­ment.
Walton himself was evidently familiar with it, and has
clearly taken his “jury of flies” from its “xij flyes wyth
whyche ye shall angle to y<sup>e</sup> trought &amp; grayl­lyng;” while
Burton, that universal plunderer, has extracted her eloquent
eulogy on the secondary pleasures of angling for incorporation
with the patchwork structure of his “Anatomy of
Melancholy.” Besides giving the earliest account of the art
of fishing, the estimate which the authoress forms of the
moral value of the craft is not only very high, but has served
to strike the keynote for all subsequent followers of the art
both in their praises and their practice of it.
To this little
treatise more than to any other belongs the credit of having
assigned in popular es­ti­ma­tion to the angler his med­i­ta­tive
and gentle nature. Many pure and noble intellects have
kindled into lasting devotion to angling on reading her
eloquent com­men­da­tion of it. Such men as Donne, Wotton,
and Herbert, Paley, Bell, and Davy, together with many
another excellent and simple dis­po­sition, have caught en­thus­iasm
from her lofty sen­ti­ments, and found that not their
bodily health only, but also their morals, were improved by
angling. It became a school of virtues, a quiet pas­time in
which, while looking into their own hearts, they learnt les­sons
of the highest wisdom, reverence, resignation, and love—love
of their fellow-men, of the lower creatures, and of their
Creator.</p>

<p>Nothing definite is known of the reputed authoress, Dame
Juliana Barnes or Berners. She is said to have been a
daughter of Sir James Berners of Roding Berners in the
county of Essex, a favourite of King Richard the Second, who
was beheaded in 1388 as an evil counsellor to the king and
an enemy to the public weal. She was celebrated for her
extreme beauty and great learning, and is reported to have
held the office of prioress of the Benedictine Nunnery of
Sopwell in Hert­ford­shire, a cell to the Abbey of St. Alban,
but of this no doc­u­ment­ary ev­i­dence exists. The first edi­tion
of her “Book of St. Alban’s,” print­ed by the school­master-printer
of St. Alban’s in 1486, treats of hawk­ing, hunt­ing,
and coat-armour. In the next ed­i­tion, “En­prynt­ed at
West­mestre by Wyn­kyn the Worde the yere of thyn­car­na­cōn
of our lorde.&#x2009;M&#x200a;.&#x200a;CCCC&#x200a;.&#x200a;lxxxxvi,”
among the other “treatyfes
perteynynge to hawkynge &amp; huntynge with other dyuers
playsaunt materes belong­ynge vnto noblesse,” appeared the
present treatise on angling. The aris­to­cratic
in­stincts of the
authoress prompted this mode of pub­li­ca­tion, as she herself
explains in the concluding paragraph—“by cause that this
present treatyse sholde not come to the hondys of eche ydle
persone whyche wolde desire it yf it were enprynted allone
by itself &amp; put in a lytyll plaunflet, therfore I haue compylyd
it in a greter volume of dyuerse bokys concernynge
to gentyll &amp; noble men to the entent that the forsayd ydle
persones whyche sholde haue but lytyll mesure in the sayd
dysporte of fysshyng sholde not by this meane vtterly dystroye
it.” The present publication is the “little pamphlet” which
was enclosed in this “greater volume.” An edition of it as
a distinct treatise appears to have been issued by Wynkyn de
Worde soon after that of 1496, with the title, “Here begynnyth
a treatyse of fysshynge wyth an Angle” over the
curious woodcut of the man fishing which is on the first page
of the present <i>facsimile</i>, but only one copy of it is known
to be in existence. At least ten more editions appeared
before the year 1600. This shows the great popularity of
the book at the time of its publication, and con­si­der­ing how
human nature remains the same, and the charms of angling
are equally grateful to every fresh generation of anglers,
affords a sufficient reason for the strong antiquarian delight
which all literary anglers of the present century have felt
in the book. It is worth while briefly to trace the bibliography
of angling onwards until the appearance in 1653
of Walton’s <i>Compleat Angler</i>, when the reader will be on
familiar ground. In the interval of more than a hundred and
fifty years between these two names of Berners and Walton,
so deeply reverenced by every true scholar of the craft,
there occur but four books on angling, though each one of
these possesses a fame peculiar to itself. First came Leonard
Mascall’s <i>Booke of Fishing with Hooke and
Line</i>, published in
1590. Taverner’s Certaine <i>Experiments concerning Fish
and Fruite</i> followed in 1600. Then came in 1613 the <i>Secrets
of Angling</i> of the celebrated angling poet, J. D. [John
Dennys], whose verses have perhaps never yet been surpassed;
and finally, in 1651, appeared Barker’s <i>Art of Angling</i>.
With this fisherman and “ambassador’s cook,” as he calls
himself, Walton must often have conversed.</p>

<p>It is a further testimony to the attractions which angling
has always possessed for contemplative natures that the art
appears here sys­tem­a­tised, so to speak, as early as the middle
of the fif­teenth cen­tury in En­gland, where it has been prac­tised
ever since with more en­thus­i­asm and skill than in other
countries. There is a sad gap in angling lit­er­a­ture from the
days of Ausonius, at the com­mence­ment of the fourth century,
to those of Dame Juliana Berners. Fly-fishing, indeed, is not
named between the time of Ælian and that of the Treatyse.
It is clearly de­scribed by the former writer, who alone among
the ancients mentions it, but in the present book it is spoken
of under the term “angling with a dubbe,” as if it were well-known
and practised. Not only so, but it is clear that the
writer had books of angling lore before her, perhaps
monkish manuscripts, as Hawkins suggests, which would be
of inestimable interest could they now be recovered. Thus in
speaking of the carp, the reader will find she writes—“as touchynge
his baytes I haue but lytyll knowlege of it. And me
were loth to wryte more than I knowe &amp; haue prouyd. But
well I wote that the redde worme &amp; the menow ben good
baytys for hym at all tymes as I haue herde saye of persones
credyble &amp; also founde wryten in bokes of credence.” No
better rules can be given for fly-fishing at present than the
two which she prescribes for angling—“for the fyrste and
pryncypall poynt in anglynge&#x2009;:&#x2009;kepe y<sup>e</sup> euer fro
the water fro
the sighte of the fysshe,” and “also loke that ye shadow not
the water as moche as ye may.” The “troughte” is to be
angled for “wyth a dubbe” [artificial fly] “in lepynge time;”
but as for the salmon, “ye may take hym&#x2009;:&#x2009;but it is seldom
seen with a dubbe at suche tyme as whan he lepith in lyke
fourme &amp; manere as ye doo take a troughte or a gryalynge.”
With the imperfect tackle and clumsy rod of those days, it
is no wonder that the capture of salmon with a fly, which is
still the crowning achievement of the craft, could seldom be
effected.</p>

<p>After the eloquent pleading for angling with which the
treatise opens, the lady at once proceeds to teach the making
of the “harnays” of it. The rod she orders to be constructed
somewhat resembles, save in its larger size, the modern
walking-stick rod. A hazel wand, or failing it, one of willow
or mountain ash, is to be procured, as thick as the arm and
nine feet in length. This is to form the butt, and is to be
hollowed out by means of divers red-hot irons into a tapering
hole, which is to receive the “croppe,” or top, as we now
call it, when not in use. This “croppe” is to be made of
a yard of hazel, joined to a length of blackthorn, crab,
medlar, or “jenypre.” All these are to be cut between
Michaelmas and Candlemas, the lady giving very particular
directions as to their drying and the like. When the two
portions of the “crop” are “fretted together,” the whole
rod is to be shaved into a shapely taper form; the staff
encircled with long hoops of iron or latten at both ends,
and finished with a “pyke in the nether ende fastnyd wyth
a rennynge vyce&#x2009;:&#x2009;to take in &amp; oute youre croppe.” The line
is then to be wound round the crop and tied fast with a bow
at the top. The reader will note that there is no mention
of a reel; it was only used, seemingly
until the beginning
of this century, for large salmon and pike. An angler who
hooked a fish when armed with this ponderous rod (which must
from its description have been nearly eighteen feet long, as
large as a modern salmon rod), would act as Izaak Walton
would have done in the like predicament,—throw the rod in to
the fish and recover it when he could. But the lady is wonderfully
pleased with this mighty rod, and thus concludes—“Thus
shall ye make you a rodde soo preuy that ye maye
walke therwyth&#x2009;:&#x2009;and there shall noo man wyte where abowte
ye goo. It woll be lyghte &amp; full nymbyll to fysshe wyth at
your luste. And for the more redynesse loo here a fygure,”
and she adds the curious woodcut which the reader may see
reproduced at page <a href="#p005" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 5">5</a>.</p>

<p>Then follow directions how to dye and make lines and
hooks. There were evidently no manufacturers of hooks
in the fifteenth century: each angler made his own. The
casting of plummets and forming of floats succeed. The
six methods of angling and the mode of playing a fish
are next treated, and the latter alone shows that Dame
Juliana must herself have been a proficient in the craft. No
one but a thoroughly good fisher could have summed up
the art of playing a fish in the words—“kepe hym euer
vnder the rodde, and euermore holde hym streyghte&#x2009;:&#x2009;soo
that your lyne may susteyne and beere his lepys and his
plungys wyth the helpe of your croppe &amp; of your honde.”
The place, the time of day, and the weather in which to fish,
are next particularly described after the exac­ti­tude peculiar
to fishing manuals of the olden time. These para­graphs are
well worth the con­si­der­a­tion of a modern angler, especially
the charge, “yf the wynde be in the Eest, that is worste
For comynly neyther wynter nor somer y<sup>e</sup> fysshe woll not
byte thenne.”</p>

<p>The following part of the treatise, with what baits and
how to angle for each kind of fish, together with a brief
description of each, certainly furnished Walton with a model
for some of his chapters. This portion of her book is
regarded by the authoress as most necessary to be known
and proficiency in carrying out her rules “is all the effecte
of the crafte.” She adds amusingly, “for ye can not brynge
an hoke in to a fyssh mouth wythout a bayte.” A few of the
quaint receipts of her age succeed; how to keep live baits,
to make pastes and the like, ending with a rule which is
often given to flyfishers for trout at the present day: “Whan
ye haue take a grete fysshe&#x2009;:&#x2009;vndo the mawe, &amp; what ye
fynde therin make that your bayte&#x2009;:&#x2009;for it is beste.”</p>

<p>Just as the authoress rises to eloquence at the beginning
of the treatise when comparing the fisher’s happy life with
the toils and troubles which too often fall to the lot of the
hunter, hawker, and fowler, so the end of these rules once
more recalls her enthusiasm. The last two pages of the book
give us a portrait of her con­cep­tion of the perfect angler,
and it is no pre­sump­tion to say that a nobler and truer
picture has never been limned. Sim­plic­i­ty of dis­po­si­tion,
for­bear­ance to our neigh­bours’ rights, and con­si­der­a­tion for
the poor, are strongly in­cul­cated. All cov­e­tous­ness in fishing
or employment of its gentle art to increase worldly gain
and fill the larder is equally condemned. She holds the
highest view of angling; that it is to serve a man for solace,
and to cause the health of his body, but especially of his
soul. So she would have him pursue his craft alone for
the most part, when his mind can rise to high and holy
things, and he may serve God devoutly by saying from his
heart his customary prayer. Nor should a man ever carry
his amusement to excess, and catch too much
at one time;
this is to destroy his future pleasure and to interfere with
that of his neighbours. A good sportsman too, she adds,
will busy himself in nourishing the game and destroying
all vermin. So will what Walton calls “the civil, well-governed
angler” escape the vices which spring from idleness,
and enjoy the full delights of an elevating and noble
recreation. “And all those that done after this rule shall
haue the blessynge of god &amp; saynt Petyr, whyche he theym
graunte that wyth his precyous blood vs boughte.”</p>

<p>“And therefore to al you that ben vertuous&#x2009;:&#x2009;gentyll&#x2009;:&#x2009;and
free borne I wryte &amp; make this symple treatyse
folowynge&#x2009;:&#x2009;by whyche ye may haue the full crafte of anglynge to
dysport you at your luste&#x2009;:&#x2009;to the entent that your aege maye

huntynge lyke as I thynke to dyscryue of it and of
alle the other. For huntynge as to myn entent is to
laboryous&#x2009;/&#x2009;For the hunter must alwaye renne
&amp; folowe his houndes&#x2009;:&#x2009;traueyllynge &amp;

y<sup>t</sup> loue it I dare not reporte. Thus truly me
semyth that this is not the beste dysporte and game of
the sayd foure. The dyspor&#x2009;|&#x2009;te and game of
hawkynge is laboryous &amp; noyouse also as me semyth.
For often the fawkener leseth his hawkes as the <span

Thenne is his game &amp; his dysporte goon. Full often

game of the sa&#x2009;|&#x2009;yd foure. The dysporte

wynter season the fowler spedyth not but in the moost
hardest and coldest weder&#x2009;:&#x2009;whyche is
greuous. For whan he wolde goo to his gynnes he maye not

Yet soryly dooth he fare. At morn tyde in the dewe he is
weete shode vnto his taylle. Many other suche I cowde
tell&#x2009;:&#x2009;but drede of magre makith me for to

also fowlynge ben so laborous and greuous that none of
theym maye perfourme nor bi very meane that enduce a man to
a me&#x2009;|&#x2009;ry spyryte&#x2009;:&#x2009;whyche is

of honndys&#x2009;:&#x2009;the blastes of hornys and the
scrye of foulis that hunters&#x2009;:&#x2009;fawkeners
&amp; foulers can make. And yf the angler take
fysshe&#x2009;:&#x2009;surely thenne is there noo
man merier than he is in his spyryte. ¶ Also who soo
woll vse the game of anglynge&#x2009;:&#x2009;he must
ryse erly. whiche thyng is prouffytable to man in
this wy&#x2009;|&#x2009;se&#x2009;/&#x2009;That is to

I haue lernyd you to make all your harnays. Here
I woll tell you how ye shall angle. ¶ Ye shall angle&#x2009;:&#x2009;vnderstonde
that there is .vi. manere of anglyng. That
one is at the grounde for the troughte and other fisshe. A nother
is at y<sup>e</sup> grounde at an arche&#x2009;/&#x2009;or at a stange where it ebbyth
and flowyth&#x2009;:&#x2009;for bleke&#x2009;:&#x2009;roche. and darse. The thyrde is wyth a
flote for all manere of fysshe. The fourth wyth a menow for y<sup>e</sup>
troughte wythout plumbe or flote. The fyfth is rennynge in y<sup>t</sup>
same wyse for roche and darse wyth one or two heeres &amp; a flye.
The syxte is wyth a dubbyd hoke for the troughte &amp; graylyng
¶ And for the fyrste and pryncypall poynt in anglynge&#x2009;:&#x2009;kepe y<sup>e</sup>
euer fro the water fro the sighte of the fysshe&#x2009;:&#x2009;other ferre on the
londe&#x2009;:&#x2009;or ellys behynde a busshe that the fysshe se you not. For
yf they doo they wol not byte. ¶ Also loke that ye shadow not
the water as moche as ye may. For it is that thynge that woll
soone fraye the fysshe. And yf a fysshe be afrayed he woll not bi&#x2009;|&#x2009;te
longe after. For alle manere fysshe that fede by the grounde
ye shall angle for theim to the botom. soo that your hokys shall
renne or lye on the grounde. And for alle other fysshe that fede
<span class="xxpn" id="p012">{12}</span> aboue ye shall angle to theym in the myddes of the water or
somdeale byneth or somdeale aboue. For euer the gretter fisshe
the nerer he lyeth the botom of the water. And euer the smaller
fysshe the more he smymmyth aboue. ¶ The thyrde good poynt
is whan the fysshe bytyth that ye be not to hasty to smyte
nor to late&#x2009;/&#x2009;For ye must abide tyll ye suppose that the bayte be
ferre in the mouth of the fysshe&#x2009;/&#x2009;and thenne abyde noo longer.
And this is for the groūde. ¶ And for the flote whan ye se it pul&#x2009;|&#x2009;lyd
softly vnder the water&#x2009;:&#x2009;or elles caryed vpon the water softly&#x2009;:&#x2009;thenne
smyte. And loke that ye neuer ouersmyte the strengthe
of your lyne for brekynge. ¶ And yf it fortune you to smyte
a grete fysshe wyth a smalle harnays&#x2009;:&#x2009;thenne ye must lede
hym in the water and labour him there tyll he be drownyd and
ouercome. Thenne take hym as well as ye can or maye. and euer
bewaar that ye holde not ouer the strengthe of your lyne.
And as moche as ye may lete hym not come out of your lynes
ende streyghte from you&#x2009;:&#x2009;But kepe hym euer vnder the rodde&#x2009;/&#x2009;and euermore holde hym streyghte&#x2009;:&#x2009;soo that your lyne may sus&#x2009;|&#x2009;teyne

<div id="dtransnote">TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

<p>Original spelling and grammar have been generally retained, with
some exceptions noted here. Long s (“ſ”, Unicode character u+017f)
have been replaced by “s”. Words that were broken at the end of a
line using a word continuation mark, either hyphen or double oblique
hyphen (u+2e17), have been rejoined. Supposed words that were broken
at the end of a line, but without a word con­tin­u­a­tion mark,
have been re­joined by inserting a vertical line (u+7c) with thin
spaces be­tween the two parts of the sup­posed word. For example,
the word “whiche” was often broken after the <i>i</i>, and would then
be tran­scribed as “whi&#x2009;|&#x2009;che”. I produced the cover
image and hereby assign it to the public domain. In the text edition,
italic text is marked with low lines (“_”, u+5f); small capitals
text is made uppercase; and superscripted text is marked with “^”
(u+5e). Original page images are available from archive.org—search
for “treatyseoffysshy00bern”.</p>

<p>The blackletter pages of the original
book had no printed page numbers. Page numbers
have been inserted into these ebook editions. If a page number
would properly lie within a broken word or a supposed
broken word, then the whole word was moved just below the
page number.</p>

<p>There were throughout the blackletter part
of the printed book instances of a symbol that re­sem­bled a
y with a smudge over it. These are likely var­i­ously e over
y or t over y, i.e. ab­brev­ia­tions for <i>the</i> and <i>that</i>.
These symbols have been tran­scribed according to con­text
as y<sup>e</sup> or y<sup>t</sup>. On page
<a href="#p016" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 16">16</a> there was
what looks like a “d” with a smudge over it, which has been
tran­scribed as “d<sup>r</sup>”. Other abbreviations that
include a smudged small letter include “wy<sup>t</sup>”,
“w<sup>t</sup>”, “togyd<sup>r</sup>”, etc. In all these
instances, the superscripted mark is a guess based on
context.</p>

<p>Paragraphs or sections in the blackletter part
were variously marked. Sections were indicated
by either <i>capitulum</i> or else drop cap.
Sparsely supported capitulum
(u+2e3f) is replaced by pilcrow (u+b6) in all editions.
The text was
justified, and some­times a capit­u­lum would be pre­ceded
by white space on the right end of a line of text and
a line-break, sometimes by only a single space. Sometimes
vertical white space preceded a capitulum or drop cap;
sometimes not. There are three instances
(see pages
<a href="#p003" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 3">3</a> and
<a href="#p009" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 9">9</a>)
of white space on the right end of a line of text followed
by a new sentence on a new line, but without either
capitulum or drop cap. In these ebook editions, either
printed vertical space or a drop cap is tran­scribed
as the beginning of a new paragraph, i.e. as a new
<i>&#x3c;&#x200a;p&#x200a;&#x3e;</i> element in the html
edition. Drop caps are indicated in the text edition by
“++” preceding the letter.</p>

<p>The colon (u+3a) is used liberally throughout
the blackletter part of the book. It was usually printed
with no space on either side; less often with a space only
on the right side; and rarely with a space only on the left
side. Examples of the latter occur at page <a href="#p004"
title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 4">4</a> line 4 and at page <a
href="#p008" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 8">8</a> line 2. In
this transcription, the colon spacing has been standardized
in the blackletter part of the book to narrow space on both
sides.</p>

<p>Likewise, the glyph we would call <i>period</i> or <i>full
stop</i> (u+2e) was variously printed with no space on either
side, or space on one or both sides. These have been
standardized to modern usage: space on right side only.
This glyph seems to have been
used variously in the ways we would use full stop or comma.
In addition, roman numerals are tran­scribed with the full
stop as in, for instance, “wyth .xij. heeres” (example
is from page <a href="#p010" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e;
10">10</a>). In many places full stops seem to be
missing from the end of a sentence; these have not been
corrected.</p>

<p>In the following sentence from page <a
href="#p001" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 1">1</a>, “Salamon
in his parablys sayth that a good spyryte makyth a
flourynge aege&#x2009;/&#x2009;that is a fayre aege &amp;
a longe.”, the “&#x2009;/&#x2009;” is our tran­scrip­tion of a glyph
shaped some­what like an
abun­dantly dis­torted “3”, com­pressed hor­i­zon­tal­ly. This
glyph has been in­ter­pret­ed herein as punc­tu­a­tion, sim­i­lar
to our modern comma or virgule. The
glyph was variously printed with no space on either side,
or with space on both sides, or with space on the right
side. In this ebook, the glyph has been tran­scribed as
solidus (u+2f) with thin space on both
sides.</p>

<p>There is one exception. On page
<a href="#p020" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 20">20</a>, line 1, the
following sentence appears: “Ye shall fede and kepe
them all in generall&#x2009;:&#x2009;but euery manere
by hymself wyth suche <span class="nowrap">thyng<img
class="iglyph-a" src="images/ia2-40-is-us.png" width="22"
height="65" alt="&#xa76d;" /></span> in and on whiche they
brede”. In these html/epub/mobi editions, the mark after
<i>thyng</i> is shown as an image of the original mark. This
mark strongly resembles the glyphs that have been elsewhere
tran­scribed as solidus, but is bolder and more angular. The
text edition tran­scribes this instance as “ꝭ”
(u+a76d, Latin small letter IS)</p>

<p class="phanga padtopb">Page
&#x2007;<a href="#p002" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 2">2</a>.
The following sentence appears: “The seconde is labour
not <span class="nowrap"> outrageo<img class="iglyph-a"
src="images/ia2-22-us.png" width="26" height="60"
alt="&#xa770;" />.”</span> In the text edition, the mark
following <i>outrageo</i> has been tran­scribed as “&#xa770;”
(u+a770, modifier letter US). This character occurs only
once in the text.</p>

<p class="phanga">Page
&#x2007;<a href="#p007" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 7">7</a>.
The phrase “For is is lyke y<sup>e</sup> wedys”
was changed to “For it is lyke y<sup>e</sup> wedys”. In the
phrase rendered herein as “that it woll desyre ynough”, it
has been suggested that the penultimate word should perhaps
be “befyxe” instead.</p>

<p class="phanga">Page
&#x2007;<a href="#p008" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 8">8</a>.
In “And gretter hokes ye shall mabe in the same
wyse”, “mabe” should perhaps be “make”?</p>

<p class="phanga">Page
<a href="#p010" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 10">10</a>.
In the illustration caption,
<span class="nowrap">“Pl<img class="iglyph-b"
src="images/ia2-28-nmacron.png" width="42" height="67"
alt="n&#x304;" />be</span>&#x2009;:&#x2009;Corke” should
perhaps be “Plūbe&#x2009;:&#x2009;Corke”.</p>

<p class="phanga">Page
<a href="#p012" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 12">12</a>.
In “the more he smymmyth aboue”, the word
should perhaps be “swymmyth”.</p>

<p class="phanga">Page
<a href="#p013" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 13">13</a>.
In “in ony other placys where ye may
se ony fyssh houe or ha&#x2009;|&#x2009;ne ony
fedynge”, “ha&#x2009;|&#x2009;ne” should perhaps be
“ha&#x2009;|&#x2009;ue”?</p>

<p class="phanga">Page
<a href="#p017" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 17">17</a>.
In the phrase rendered herein
“heeryd&#x2009;:&#x2009;&amp; the hon&#x2009;|&#x2009;ie
combe.”, “hon&#x2009;|&#x2009;ie” was originally printed as
“hou&#x2009;|&#x2009;ie”.</p>

<p class="phanga">Page
<a href="#p018" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 18">18</a>.
A smudge after the ampersand was ignored in the phrase “on
the osyer &amp; the codworme”.</p>

<p class="phanga">Page
<a href="#p019" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 19">19</a>.
In “cast it in the water wyth a corde &amp;
a corke&#x2009;”, the illegible mark ahead of “cord” has
been tran­scribed “a ”. Also, the phrase “or ellis on
y<sup>e</sup> <span class="nowrap">gro<img class="iglyph-b"
src="images/ia2-28-nmacron.png" width="42" height="67"
alt="n&#x304;" />de”</span> possibly should be “or ellis on
y<sup>e</sup> groūde”.</p>

<p class="phanga">Page
<a href="#p020" title="go to &#x70;&#x2e; 20">20</a>. In
“But whan they ben in a slough”, the original print looked
like <span class="nowrap">“ben|in”,</span> with a thick
black line between “ben” and “in”. In the phrase “¶ A
nother take the sewet”, there was a smudge after “nother”
that might be taken for a comma, removed from this ebook
edition. There were no other commas in the blackletter
section of the book.</p>

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
